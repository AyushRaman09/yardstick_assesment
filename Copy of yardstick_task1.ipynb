Elephant speech for students and children in English. Good morning to 1 and all present here. Today, I'll be giving a small speech on the topic elephant. Elephants are one of the largest animals in the world and are intelligent as a species. These 4 legged creatures are herbivorous. Their diet does predominantly consist of leaves, plants, and grains. Bananas, commonly, are considered to be a favorite of theirs. Elephants are mostly found in Asia and Africa. They are commonly gray and black. Island alone is known to have white elephants. The average lifespan of an elephant ranges between 5 70 years. They live both in herds and in solitude. They are crucial in preserving the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Nowadays, elephants are getting increasingly endangered. In our pursuit of animal from tusk and leather, we are wiping away their habitat, subjecting them to cruelty and killing them off. Let's vow to protect them. Thank you.\"}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"McCcM_8LzCav"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
